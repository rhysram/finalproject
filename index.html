         	<br>While my midterm project had lots of hand-drawn graphics, I want my final to be simple. There’s something charming about the “main character” being something as minimalistic as a circle or square, and I feel inspired by my classmates' simplistic projects where the player controls an ellipse or rectangle. I’m also thinking about games like Snake, Agar.io, or mazes / navigating levels and avoiding the edges. I want to make something unique yet easy to understand and almost addictive.<br>
           Minimalist-graphic game ideas:<br>
         - Maze / obstacle course<br>
         - Snake (with increasing obstacles/levels)<br>
         - Endless run (like temple run)<br>
         - A game like agar.io (player gains points but also gets bigger, making it harder to avoid obstacles)<br>
         - A speed-based game (player must click, or type something in a limited amount of time)<br>
         - A platformer that doesn’t scroll, like donkey kong, player must reach the top and avoid obstacles<br>
         - - Actually I really like this idea, I think I could put a spin on a donkey-kong-like “reach the top” platformer, where after each level the course gets more difficult. It may take a while to figure out the mechanics of a platformer but I remember creating games like that on Scratch as a kid, I could translate the block-logic I used into JavaScript<br>
         - - I can make a sort of simplistic mashup between donkey kong / manic miner / geometry dash… the player controls a square, who wants something at the top of the level, and each time it reaches it a new level starts with increasing difficulty.<br>
         - - I kinda want this main character to eventually reach what they want… maybe I can make a “story mode” and an “unlimited mode”, where at the start of the game the player can choose if they want to follow the story and the character eventually gets what they want (you win!) or an unlimited version that goes forever, getting as many points as possible (only ends with you losing eventually)<br>
         Basics I'll need for this… multiple stages / backgrounds (will eventually repeat on unlimited mode), moving obstacles / enemies (can get faster / bigger over time), player mechanics (character is always falling but the top of the platform stops it? I'll probably use colors / get to determine the tops of platforms) and a jumping mechanic (character increases in y, then decreases back to start… have a jumping variable that switches on/off so player can’t double jump)
